# danaviz

A collection of mini visualizations that act as small wins on my journey to learn D3.js

## Introduction

This collection is inspired by [Shirley Wu](http://sxywu.com) after asking her advice on how to learn D3.js. Her advice was that doing little things were like "small wins" that made her feel good.

## Goals

- **Make each visualization responsive.** Responsive design was my main task in all things web dev. The growing use of mobile makes it so much more important to scale visualizations down from desktop to mobile devices.

- *More to come!*
